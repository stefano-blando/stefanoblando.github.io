This project reproduces and extends the **Fagiolo & Dosi (2003) Island Model** — a landmark agent-based model of endogenous economic growth — using **MultiVeStA**, a tool for sequential statistical model checking of stochastic systems.

The paper was accepted at **MARS @ ETAPS 2026** (Workshop on Models for Formal Analysis of Real Systems, European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software).

*Work with Giorgio Fagiolo, Daniele Giachini, Andrea Vandin, and Ernest Ivanaj (Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna).*

## What the Model Does

The Island Model captures endogenous growth through the interaction of three types of heterogeneous agents operating on a fitness landscape:

- **Miners** exploit their current productive niche, accumulating skills over time
- **Imitators** copy the most successful visible agent, diffusing knowledge across the economy with probability φ
- **Explorers** search for new islands at random, driving innovation and preventing lock-in

The key insight is that the tension between exploitation and exploration — parameterised by ε — generates self-sustaining growth dynamics without requiring exogenous technological progress.

## What MultiVeStA Adds

Standard Monte Carlo analysis uses a fixed number of simulation runs with no formal guarantee on estimation quality. MultiVeStA applies **sequential statistical model checking**: it runs simulations adaptively, stopping only when the 95% confidence interval on E[logGDP] is narrower than δ=0.05 at every time step. This provides a formal precision guarantee — the sample size is determined by the data variance, not by the experimenter.

Our analysis confirms the **optimality of moderate exploration** (ε ≈ 0.1), reproduces all stylized facts of the original model, and establishes through Welch t-test counterfactual analysis that 6 out of 7 pairwise parameter comparisons yield statistically distinguishable growth trajectories. The single exception (ρ=3.0 vs ρ=5.0) reveals a **saturation effect** in knowledge locality.

## Interactive Explorer

The interactive app lets you explore the model live: watch agents move across the technology landscape, observe imitation cascades and exploration events, run MultiVeStA sensitivity analysis on α, φ, and ρ, and see how the sequential sampling converges.
