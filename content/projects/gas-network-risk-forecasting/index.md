This project was developed for the **Hera Group Hackathon**, where it earned **2nd place**. The task was to detect gas leak risk in a setting dominated by imbalance, sparse events, and operational uncertainty.

The pipeline combines geospatial-temporal feature engineering with synthetic data augmentation through **CTGAN** and **TimeGAN**, then uses **SHAP** to keep the final model interpretable rather than purely predictive.

What I still like about this project is its balance between pragmatism and method: it is a hackathon project, but it already reflects an approach I use often, namely trying to make difficult prediction problems more robust without giving up explainability.
