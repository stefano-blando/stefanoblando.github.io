This project explores the intersection of **precise computer vision** and **generative image editing** by combining **Segment Anything (SAM)** with **Stable Diffusion XL**.

The core idea is straightforward: segmentation provides exact control over what should be changed, while diffusion-based inpainting provides the generative flexibility to actually change it. That makes the system useful not only as a demo, but as a concrete example of how discriminative and generative models can be combined inside the same workflow.

Built in **Python** with **PyTorch**, **Diffusers**, and **Gradio**, the project supports interactive masking, object replacement, and background generation while keeping the pipeline lightweight enough to run on consumer hardware with the right optimizations.
