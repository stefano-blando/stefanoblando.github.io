This project is the technical implementation behind the publication **“A Multi-Method Validation Framework for Large-Scale Multilingual Text Analytics”** (JADT 2026, in review). It operationalizes the full analytical workflow used in the paper, from data preparation to cross-method validation and result comparison.

The pipeline combines **R and Python** modules over a large multilingual review corpus, including: preprocessing and TF-IDF, **LDA topic modeling**, **LSA and Correspondence Analysis**, lexicon- and model-based sentiment analysis, clustering, and **co-occurrence network analysis**. The repository also includes cross-platform validation scripts to compare method outputs and check structural stability across implementations.

The central objective is methodological robustness: verifying which findings remain consistent when methods, model families, and language-specific components vary. In this sense, the project is not a generic NLP demo, but a reproducible research pipeline designed for quantitative validation of text-analytic conclusions.
