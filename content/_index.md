      subtitle: 'Agent-Based Computational Economics meets Artificial Intelligence'
      text: |
        My research lies at the intersection of **Agent-Based Computational Economics** and **Artificial Intelligence**, within the National PhD Program in AI for Society (SSSA & UniPi).

          I develop **adaptive cognitive architectures** for economic agents that co-evolve their decision strategies and social connections within complex networks — moving beyond static equilibrium toward realistic, heterogeneous, and adaptive behavior.


        ### Core Research Pillars:

        * **Adaptive Agents & Network Formation:** Designing multi-tier cognitive architectures (MARL + GNN) where agents learn *how* to learn, forming and rewiring economic networks endogenously. Exploring **Agentic AI** (LLM-based deliberative agents) as a novel layer for economic simulation.
        * **Formal Validation & Statistical Model Checking:** Employing **Statistical Model Checking** (MultiVeStA) and HPC-driven analysis to rigorously validate agent-based models under structural uncertainty, bridging the gap between  theoretical simulations and empirical reality.
        * **Robust Statistics & Functional Data Analysis:** Applying **robust high-dimensional methods** and Functional Data Analysis to ground complex models in real-world data — from macro-financial panel data to network topology signals for systemic risk detection.
